private
===============================

private - a simpler, yet better implementation of Commander, a module launcher.

* Free software: MIT license

Features
--------
* Shell and Dispatch modes.

* Typed params.

* Every param is to be input, separately; with every query having a description, default value etc.


ToDo
----
* Write mock code and tests, first.

* Decide between supporting multiple args vs. a single dictionary arg.

* Only enter shell, when TTY is available.

* A separate types library.
