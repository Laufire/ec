ToDo
=====

Tasks
-----
* Extract sphinxdoc as a separate package.

* Take care of sphinx version collission. There might be multiple verions of sphinx which could cause problems like missing themes.

* Adding sphinx.ext.napoleon.

Check
-----

* Using absolute paths like rst's **include** directive, instead of autodoc styled imports. Beware of module path collisions.
