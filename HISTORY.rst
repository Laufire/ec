	* 2355	Preparation done.

* 150625

	* 1000	Decided to use a single dictionary arg as the way to provide data to the functions, over using multiple args (the common python way), as the former is more elegant. And also because kwargs aren't available on other platforms, t2hus making the implementation of the API, hard.
	* 1745	The development of the library is suspended, as the intended improvements over commander are added to commander itself.

* 150629

	* 1440	Resumed the development.
	* 1740	Dispatch mode completed.
	* 2200	Shell mode completed.

	* 2050	Linted the scripts.

	* 2005	Command routes are now separated by '/', instead of ' '; in order to closely emulate query strings.
	* 2005	Dispatch mode now supports **None** inputs, through omitted '=' signs after the arg names. ie: in *task1 a b=1*, the value of **a** will be **None**.

* 150703

	* 1545	Tried, but failed to automate the building of README.rst with sphinx, to be used as the long_description for the package (which would be used as the home page in PyPI); as there wasn't a way to dynamically generate rst-s fr static rst files.
